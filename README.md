# Heisenberg Chain Model

## Context 

A program made for the end term project in AM3911 at the University of Western Ontario. Accompanied by a research paper, topics were chosen based on interest with some direction given by professor when choosing a topic.

## What does it do?

This program simulates a Heisenberg chain model. This is similar to the Ising model, except spins are 3 dimensional. 

## Conclusion

Not a serious multi-file project in C++, but a good exercise in scientific computing.
